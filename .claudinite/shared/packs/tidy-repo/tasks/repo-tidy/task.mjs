// tidy-repo task: repo-tidy — the whole nightly tidy-up in one unit
// (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §6). One worker assesses this repo's branches
// and PRs read-only, acts on its issues, then reconciles the standing tracker
// from the verdicts. Worker: task.md. The old undeclared-canon carve-out dies —
// the canon repo declares tidy-repo like everyone else.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.

// Branches the tidy review must never assess. Beyond the default branch, the
// orphan `conversation-logs` branch is a grow_with_claudinite artifact (the
// captured-transcript stream, not project work) — it shares no history with main,
// so single-branch-status would flag it "orphaned" for a human on every widen. It
// is infrastructure the tidy sweep ignores altogether. Kept as a bare literal, not
// an import: the pack-independence barrier forbids tidy-repo from reaching into
// grow_with_claudinite, and the name is a fixed, well-known one. The stable
// maintenance branch is likewise never a tidy target — it is Claudinite's own
// standing delivery branch, not project work.

// A precondition has no repo handle, so it cannot look up the actual default
// branch name to drop it from the tidy candidate set — and the `branches` signal
// carries every open branch, the default included. Presuming the conventional
// default names here keeps a genuinely quiet repo (only its default branch open,
// no window activity) from firing tidy every night, which is the whole point of
// the gate. The worker (task.md) remains the authority that never assesses the
// repo's real default branch, so a repo whose default is unconventionally named
// is still safe — its default just also becomes a (cheap, read-only) tidy
// candidate here.
